- Purple tones

### Cursor-Based Pagination
- No offset issues at scale
- Efficient database queries
- Accurate page navigation

### Export Functionality
**CSV Format:**
- Headers: Contract ID, Event Type, Ledger, Timestamp, Transaction, Payload
- Properly escaped values
- Opens in Excel/Google Sheets

**JSON Format:**
- Pretty-printed with 2-space indentation
- Complete event objects
- Easy to parse programmatically

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Tab | Navigate between filters |
| Enter | Apply filters (when in input) |
| Escape | Close modal |
| Arrow Keys | Navigate table (browser default) |

## Mobile Usage

On mobile devices (< 768px):
- Time and Transaction columns are hidden
- Filters stack vertically
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Scrollable table

## Troubleshooting

### No Events Showing
1. Make sure a contract is selected
2. Check if filters are too restrictive
3. Try clearing filters with "Clear" button

### Export Not Working
1. Check browser allows downloads
2. Ensure events are loaded
3. Try a different format (CSV vs JSON)

### Copy Not Working
1. Browser must support Clipboard API
2. Page must be served over HTTPS (or localhost)
3. User must interact with page first

### Slow Loading
1. Reduce date range
2. Select specific event type
3. Check network connection

## API Requirements

The dashboard requires these GraphQL queries to be available:

```graphql
# Load all contracts
query AllContracts {
  contracts {
    contractId
    name
  }
}

# Load event types for a contract
query EventTypes($contractId: String!) {
  eventTypes(contractId: $contractId)
}

# Load events with filters
query ExplorerEvents(
  $contractId: String!
  $eventType: String
  $limit: Int!
  $offset: Int!
  $since: DateTime
  $until: DateTime
) {
  events(
    contractId: $contractId
    eventType: $eventType
    limit: $limit
    offset: $offset
    since: $since
    until: $until
  ) {
    id
    eventType
    ledger
    eventIndex
    timestamp
    txHash
    payload
    contractId
    contractName
  }
}
```

## Development

### Running Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test -- __tests__/dashboard-components.test.tsx
```

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Customization

### Changing Page Size
Edit `PAGE_SIZE` constant in `EventExplorerDashboard.tsx`:
```typescript
const PAGE_SIZE = 20; // Change to desired size
```

### Modifying Colors
Event type colors are defined in `EventTable.tsx`:
```typescript
const colors = [
  "rgba(0, 255, 156, 0.8)",  // Green
  "rgba(0, 212, 255, 0.8)",  // Cyan
  "rgba(255, 170, 0, 0.8)",  // Orange
  "rgba(255, 102, 255, 0.8)", // Purple
];
```

### Adding New Filters
1. Add state to `EventExplorerDashboard.tsx`
2. Add UI control to `FilterBar.tsx`
3. Update `fetchExplorerEvents` call with new parameter
4. Update GraphQL query if needed

## Best Practices

### Performance
- Keep page size reasonable (20-50 items)
- Use specific filters to reduce data
- Export in batches for large datasets

### User Experience
- Always select a contract first
- Use search for quick filtering
- Check event details before exporting
- Clear filters when switching contracts

### Data Management
- Export regularly for backup
- Use JSON for programmatic processing
- Use CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- Copy individual IDs for investigation
